# Time Series Analysis

This repository contains a detailed exploration of time series analysis using Python. The analysis is divided into two main sections: data reading & understanding and time series decomposition.

### Importing Data
Instructions and code for importing data into the analysis environment.

## Part 2: Time Series

### Date Structure Transformation
Explanation and methods for transforming date structures for time series analysis.

### Additive Decomposition
Overview of additive decomposition in time series analysis, including its application and benefits.

### Multiplicative Decomposition
Overview of multiplicative decomposition in time series analysis, including its application and benefits.

### Both Decomposition
Comparison and analysis of both additive and multiplicative decomposition methods.

### Decomposition with Logarithm
Insights into how logarithmic transformations can enhance time series models and their impact on decomposition.

    <p style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Logarithmic transformation often yields better predictive models. The standard deviation of the log multiplicative model is lower, providing better results in forecasting.</p>
