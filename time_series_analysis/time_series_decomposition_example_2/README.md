# Time Series Analysis

This repository contains a detailed exploration of time series analysis using Python. The analysis is divided into three main sections: data reading & understanding, time series decomposition, and prediction.

## Part 1: Reading & Understanding Data

### Importing Libraries Needed in This Notebook
This section covers the essential libraries needed for time series analysis and their import into the notebook.

### Importing Data
Instructions and code for importing data into the analysis environment.

## Part 2: Time Series

### Date Structure Transformation
Explanation and methods for transforming date structures for time series analysis.

### Additive Decomposition
Overview of additive decomposition in time series analysis, including its application and benefits.

### Multiplicative Decomposition
Overview of multiplicative decomposition in time series analysis, including its application and benefits.

## Part 3: Prediction

### Preparation
Steps and considerations for preparing the data for prediction modeling.

### OLS Regression
An exploration of Ordinary Least Squares regression for time series prediction.

### Basic Prediction Modeling
Basic prediction modeling techniques and their application to the data. Although the forecast structure seems correct, there are deviations in some years, for example after 2020. Since these are the most primitive estimation methods, they are not used today.
