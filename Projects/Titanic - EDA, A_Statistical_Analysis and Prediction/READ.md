## Overview

In the early 1900s, the Titanic, an iconic ship built by White Star Line, was set to challenge Cunard's dominance in the luxury passenger transportation industry. While Cunard focused on speed, White Star Line aimed to provide unparalleled comfort to its passengers.

## Competition with Cunard

Cunard had recently introduced two new ships, Lusitania and Mauretania, which were renowned for their speed and record-breaking voyages across the Atlantic. In response, White Star Line decided to construct three grand ships, including the Titanic, to captivate the market with luxurious amenities and unmatched opulence.

## The Maiden Voyage

On April 10, 1912, the Titanic embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, destined for New York. The ship made stops at Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown, Ireland, before heading towards its final destination.

## Tragedy Strikes

However, tragedy struck in the early hours of April 15, 1912. While sailing through the icy waters of the North Atlantic, the Titanic collided with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland. Despite being hailed as an "unsinkable" ship, the Titanic succumbed to the force of the impact and gradually sank.

## Remembering the Titanic

The sinking of the Titanic remains one of the most tragic maritime disasters in history. It serves as a reminder of the human cost of overconfidence and the importance of prioritizing safety in all aspects of life.
